# SEC_SCH_DATABASE

Welcome to the Secondary School SQL sample Database! This readme will provide you with a basic understanding of the database and guide you through its setup and usage.

Introduction

The SEC_SCH sample database has three schemas 'REC', 'ACA' and 'WORKS, and these schemas have twenty tables
This Secondary School SQL Database is designed to store and manage various types of information related to a secondary school. It enables efficient storage, organization, and retrieval of data pertaining to students, teachers, subjects, and other school-related entities.

Files included

SEC_SCH SAMPLE DATABASE- CREATE OBJECTS.ipynb: This notebook consisting of the SQL script to create the database, create the schemas and create the table
SEC_SCH SAMPLE DATABASE- LOAD DATA.ipynb: This notebook consist of the SQL script to insert values into the tables created
SEC_SCH SAMPLE DATABASE- SQL QUERIES.ipynb:There are some sample SQL queries in this notebook to get you started with the Secondary School SQL Database. Feel free to explore and customize queries based on your specific requirements.


Features

The SQL database offers the following key features:

Student Information: Store and manage student details such as names, addresses, contact information, and academic records.

Parent Information : Store and manage parents records like parent names, addressess, contact information and relationship to students.

Staff Information: Keep track of staff profiles, including their names, job type, qualifications, addressess and contact details.

Subject Management: Manage information about the subjects offered at the school, including subject names, descriptions, prerequisites, and schedules.


Setup Instructions

To set up the Secondary School SQL Database, follow these simple steps:

1. Requirements: Ensure that you have a compatible database management system (DBMS) installed, such as MySQL or SQL Server. Install the necessary DBMS software if it's not already installed.

2. Database Creation: Create a new database within your DBMS. Use the DBMS command-line interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) tool to execute the appropriate SQL command, such as `CREATE DATABASE sec_sch;`.

3. Table Creation: Create the necessary tables by executing the SQL script provided in the SEC_SCH SAMPLE DATABASE- CREATE OBJECT file. Use the DBMS interface or a SQL client tool to run the script.

4. Data Import: import the data by executing the SQL script provided in the SEC_SCH SAMPLE DATABASE- LOAD DATA file .If you have existing datas, follow the instructions provided with the dataset to import the data into the appropriate tables. This may involve using the DBMS tools or executing SQL commands to insert data into the tables.

5. Configuration: Modify the database configuration file, if applicable, to ensure the correct connection details are specified for your DBMS.

6. Access and Usage: You can now access the Secondary School SQL Database using your preferred SQL client or programming language. Connect to the database using the appropriate credentials and start querying, updating, or managing the data as required.
